		COVID-19( THE CURRENT PANDEMIC )-:
We have heard of great wars and their effects, but here comes the greatest of all the wars and the pandemics and the name is Novel Coronavirus basically known as Covid-19 as it was first detected in December-2019 in Wuhan, China and since then it spread globally as there were no measure taken by the chinese government and world health organization to stop them. Today, more than 4.71 million cases are active over 188 countries and territories, resulting in death of more than 315,000 people and over 1.73 million have recovered. It is a huge ratio which has never been observed in a long decade.
The common symptoms of these pandemic which has been observed till now is fever ,cough , breathing problems and loss of smell and taste. The most important thing about these virus is that its symptoms are observed after 14 days which make it less detectable and most dangerous. It is a communicable disease which spread through close contact, touch small droplet produced by coughing, talking and sneezing. A study says that lungs are most effected by the coronavirus. Autopsies of people who died of COVID 19 have found diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory infiltrates within the lung. 
Some of the prevention techniques which can reduce the effect of this virus from spreading are-:
•	Food which result in strengthening of our immune body system are highly recommended
•	Washing of hand with soap and water or use of an alcohol based sanitizer can be very impactful in reducing the chances of stoppage of virus to enter into our body.
•	Covering of nose and mouth while coughing and sneezing or use of a N-95 mask is highly recommended
•	 Avoid close contact with a person suffering from cold or flu and the most common thing i.e  social-distancing can be very useful
•	If you suffer from cough or difficulty in breathing, suddenly seek  medical care early and make yourself home quarantined as soon as possible.

The current methods which are being to taste the positivity of coronavirus is the screening method for a bulk and two types of test which are being used are-:
•	A viral test which tells you wheather you have a current infection or not.
•	A antibody test which tells you wheather you had a previous infection.
An antibody test may not be able to show if you have a current infection, because it can take 1-3 weeks after infection to make antibodies. We do not know yet if having antibodies to the virus can protect someone from getting infected with the virus again, or how long that protection might last.
Current method of treatment which are being performed to cure the disease-:
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved limited emergency use for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, had announced on 19 March that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine/Plaquenil, used to treat malaria and arthritis, were approved by the FDA to be tested as a treatment for COVID-19
Chloroquine is being tested in various clinical trials conducted by government agencies and academic institutions. Other antivirals drugs are also planned to be fast-tracked for testing for coronavirus.

 According to WHO, till now there is no any vaccine which has been developed and is effectively working. All the Superpower countries are suffering a lot from this pandemic as USA has been the most impactful country from the Novel coronavirus. This pandemic has resulted in huge loss in GDP growth of a country. Peoples are suffering from loss of jobs and a huge poverty line and a hunger problem has been the major problem during these virus outbreak.All the malls, shops, factories are suffering from a huge loss which can be a disastrous situation in a coming future.
Major studies says that the most populous countries are going to suffer a lot from these pandemics. Only social distancing can help us
